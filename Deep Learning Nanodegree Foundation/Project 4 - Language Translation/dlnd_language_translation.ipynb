Since the dataset you're using only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that you use, you're only going to see good results using these words.

However, this will take you days to train, so make sure you've a GPU and the neural network is performing well on dataset we provided.  Just make sure you play with the WMT10 corpus after you've submitted this project.\n",
